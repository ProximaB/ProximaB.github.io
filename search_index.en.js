mapping is a technique used in Domain-Driven Design (DDD) to facilitate the management of relationships and interactions between different bounded contexts within a larger domain. This technique has been successfully applied in several fields, including software development, engineering, and aerospace.\nOne example of how context mapping could be applied in the aerospace industry is in the development of complex projects like the F-22 Raptor. The F-22 was a product of various companies, each with their own specialized knowledge domains related to the aircraft's development. To ensure efficient collaboration and development of the F-22, context mapping techniques could have been utilized to identify the different bounded contexts involved in the project, such as avionics, engines, aerodynamics, and weapons systems. The relationships and dependencies between these contexts could have been mapped out, allowing each company to focus on their own areas of expertise while still working together effectively.\nBy utilizing context mapping, the companies involved in the F-22's development would have been able to determine what each context or team expected to receive from the other teams, and what they needed to contribute in order to build a complete, functional aircraft. This approach could have helped to ensure that the F-22 Raptor was developed efficiently and effectively, with each company contributing their specialized knowledge and expertise to the project.\nIntroduction to context map relations\nContext maps are powerful tools for visualizing the relationships between different contexts and teams in a system. They enable you to identify patterns and interactions between teams and see how they affect each other. This is essential for understanding the structure and functionality of existing systems or applications, as well as planning the design of new ones. In this article, we will explore the most common context map patterns and their applications.\nContext maps are particularly helpful in identifying management issues between applications and teams. They can reveal how teams communicate and their influence on each other. Using context mapping, it is possible to gain a clear understanding of where and how bad models are propagated in the system.\nContext map patterns are categorized in three types:\n\n\nUpstream patterns: Open Host Service and Event Publisher\n\n\nMidway patterns: Shared Kernel, Published Language, Separate Ways, Partnership\n\n\nDownstream patterns: Customer/Supplier, Conformist, Anti-Corruption Layer\n\n\nOpen / Host Service\nThe Open Host Service pattern involves exposing an API defined by a bounded context that allows other systems to integrate with it. This relationship is particularly useful when there are multiple integrators, allowing each team to maintain their own integrations. The ideal scenario is where the API is only expanding, except when a single team has special needs and the API has to be expanded, breaking the downstream hierarchy. However, the previous API should always be preserved for already integrated systems.\nShared Kernel\nThe Shared Kernel is a pattern in context mapping where multiple teams collaborate to extract common parts of several contexts into a shared module or context, reducing code duplication and ensuring consistency in the system. The process involves defining a common subset of the domain model, which requires teams to agree on a common set of terms and concepts. Once defined, the common subset can be implemented in a shared module or context, enabling each team to align their work with the rest of the system. This approach is valuable when there is a high degree of collaboration and need for consistency across multiple bounded contexts. By implementing the Shared Kernel pattern, teams can improve consistency and reduce code duplication, leading to a more efficient and effective system.\nThe Shared Kernel approach is often a natural choice for libraries, as it allows for code reuse and reduces duplication. However, in the context of domain modeling, the approach can sometimes create additional coupling between different contexts, making the system more fragile and less resilient to changes. This is particularly true when the contexts have significantly different needs and objectives, or when a high degree of autonomy is required for each context.\nWhile the Shared Kernel approach can be useful in some situations, it is important to carefully consider the needs of each context before implementing it. In cases where the contexts have different needs or objectives, or where a high degree of autonomy is required, other approaches, such as the Anti-Corruption Layer or Separate Ways patterns, may be more appropriate. By choosing the right approach for each context, developers can create a more resilient and effective system.\nSeparated ways\nThe Separate Ways pattern in context mapping is a powerful technique that can help developers minimize dependencies between different contexts. By allowing each context to have its own domain model and business logic, this approach can reduce coupling and make the system more resilient to changes.\nThe Separate Ways pattern can be very beneficial when working with multiple contexts that have unique needs and objectives. By isolating each context, developers can prevent changes in one area from affecting others. This helps to create a more modular and manageable system, ultimately leading to a more efficient and effective product.\nFor example, imagine a system with several contexts that all share some common concepts but have separate implementations for those concepts. Using the Separate Ways pattern, each context can have its own domain model and business logic, allowing developers to make changes to one context without affecting the others. This makes it easier to maintain the system and can help to reduce the risk of unintended consequences from changes made in one context.\nTo implement the Separate Ways pattern, developers need to carefully define the boundaries of each context and ensure that they are properly isolated from each other. This may involve setting up clear communication channels between contexts and using well-defined interfaces to exchange data between them. By taking these steps, developers can effectively implement the Separate Ways pattern and create a more resilient and efficient system.\nAnticorruption layer\nThe anticorruption layer pattern addresses scenarios in which it is not desirable or worth the effort to conform to the supplier's model, such as: When the downstream bounded context contains a core subdomain.\nThis type of relationship is often used to adapt a legacy system to a new architecture, and gradually migrate from the legacy codebase. The Anticorruption layer acts as an adapter that translates data from the upstream and protects it from unwanted changes.\nPublish language\n\n“The translation between the models of two bounded contexts requires a common language. Use a well-documented shared language that can express the necessary domain information as a common medium of communication, translating as necessary into and out of that language. Published Language is often combined with Open Host Service.” [Evans 2003]\n\nIt is basically a relation that is based on some shared, well-defined common language, which could be e.g. xml, protobuf, GTFS, vcard.\nPartnership\nThe Partnership pattern is a context map pattern that involves a cooperative relationship between two contexts that have dependent goals. In this pattern, two teams work together to align their goals and collaborate to achieve their objectives.\nThe Partnership strategy is beneficial when two or more teams are dependent on each other's work to achieve their goals. For example, one team may be responsible for developing the backend of an application, while another team is responsible for the frontend. Both teams need to work together to ensure that the frontend and backend are integrated seamlessly and that the application functions as expected.\nIn a Partnership relationship, both teams are responsible for ensuring that their work aligns with the goals of the other team. They communicate regularly to ensure that they are on the same page and to identify any potential issues that may arise.\nThis pattern is particularly useful in situations where there is a high degree of interdependence between teams, and where communication and collaboration are critical to the success of the project. By working together in a Partnership relationship, teams can ensure that their work is aligned, and that the project is completed on time and within budget.\nCustomer-supplier\nThe Customer-supplier pattern describes the relationship between two contexts where one provides data or services (upstream) and the other consumes them (downstream). Both contexts must establish clear communication channels and agree on the format and quality of the data or services being provided to ensure effective collaboration. This pattern is useful when there is a clear connection between the two contexts and the downstream context relies on the data or services provided by the upstream context to function effectively.\nConformist\nThe Conformist pattern is a valuable approach in context mapping that facilitates collaboration between two bounded contexts. It occurs when the downstream context is able to embrace and implement the upstream context's model without needing to make any changes or modifications. his pattern is applicable when there is a high degree of consistency and alignment between the two contexts, allowing for seamless integration of the upstream context's model into the downstream context's system.\nBy adopting the Conformist pattern, the downstream context is able to align itself with the upstream context's model, which promotes consistency and reduces the risk of errors or inefficiencies in the system. It can also lead to more efficient communication and collaboration between the two contexts, ultimately resulting in a more effective and streamlined system.\nEvent publisher\nA domain event is a term used to describe something that happened in the past and is relevant to domain experts. Upstream contexts publish all their domain events through a messaging system, and downstream contexts can subscribe to the events that are relevant for them and conform or transform those events in their models.\nLinks:\nDDD-strategic-patterns\nDomain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software, by Eric Evans, Addison-Wesley 2004\nDDD bounded contexts\nDomains subdomain roblem\n","id":"https://proximab.github.io/blog/2022/context-mapping/","title":"Context mapping"},"https://proximab.github.io/blog/2022/streaming-data-with-go/":{"body":"\nStreaming data with Go\nIn the world of web development, streaming data is a common requirement for applications to function efficiently. Whether it is transferring large files or processing real-time data from external services, streaming allows for seamless and faster data transfer. In this article, we will explore how to use Go for streaming data without the need for large memory allocation.\nIntroduction to data transfer\nData transfer is the process of moving data from one location to another. In web development, data transfer can occur between a server and a client or between two services. The data can be in various formats, including text, images, audio, or video. The traditional approach to data transfer is to read the entire file into memory and then transfer it. However, this approach is not always feasible, especially for large files or real-time data.\nBasic example with io. file interface\nWhen we transfer data between two endpoints, we usually send it in a single chunk. For instance, when downloading a file from the internet, we download the entire file in one go. The same thing happens when we read a file using Go's io package.\nfile, err := os.Open(\"file.txt\")\nif err != nil {\n    log.Fatal(err)\n}\ndefer file.Close()\n\ndata, err := ioutil.ReadAll(file)\nif err != nil {\n    log.Fatal(err)\n}\n\nThe above code reads the entire contents of the file.txt file into memory before processing it. This works well for small files, but can be problematic for large files.\nConcerns about performance and ways to optimize it\nWhen dealing with large files, reading the entire file into memory can consume a lot of resources. This can lead to slow performance, high memory usage, and even crashes. To avoid these issues, we need to find ways to optimize the data transfer process.\nOne way to optimize the data transfer process is to use streaming. Streaming allows us to transfer data in small, manageable chunks. This can help reduce memory usage and improve performance.\nWhy big memo allocation is bad thing\nWhen we allocate a large amount of memory in one go, it can cause several problems. First, it can cause performance issues because allocating memory is an expensive operation. Second, it can lead to memory fragmentation, which can make it difficult to find contiguous blocks of memory.\nStreaming data using pipe\nGo provides a convenient way to stream data using pipes. A pipe is a communication channel between two Go routines that can be used to transfer data.\nreader, writer := io.Pipe()\n\ngo func() {\n    data := []byte(\"Hello, World!\")\n    _, err := writer.Write(data)\n    if err != nil {\n        log.Fatal(err)\n    }\n    writer.Close()\n}()\n\nbuf := make([]byte, 1024)\nn, err := reader.Read(buf)\nif err != nil {\n    log.Fatal(err)\n}\nfmt.Println(string(buf[:n]))\n\nIn the above code, we create a pipe using io.Pipe(). We then create a Go routine that writes data to the pipe and closes it. Finally, we read data from the pipe using reader.Read(). Since the data is streamed in small chunks, we can process it as it arrives without allocating a large amount of memory.\nStreaming Data from Another Service to Client Over TCP with Splice\nWe can also use pipes to transfer data between two endpoints over a network. For instance, if we have a server that produces data and a client that consumes it, we can use pipes to transfer the data over TCP.\nserverConn, err := net.Dial(\"tcp\", \"localhost:8000\")\nif err != nil {\n    log.Fatal(err)\n}\ndefer serverConn.Close()\n\nclientConn, err := net.Dial(\"tcp\", \"localhost:9000\")\nif err != nil {\n    log.Fatal(err)\n}\ndefer clientConn.Close()\n\ngo func() {\n    _, err := io.Copy(serverConn, clientConn)\n    if err != nil {\n        log.Fatal(err)\n    }\n}()\n\n_, err = io.Copy(clientConn, serverConn)\nif err != nil {\n    log.Fatal(err)\n}\n\nIn the above code, we create two TCP connections, one for the server and one for the client. We then use io.Copy() to transfer data between the two endpoints. Since the data is streamed using pipes, we can process it as\nStreaming data from another service to client over tcp with splice\nUsing pipes, we can read and write data to and from files, network connections, and other I/O sources in a way that minimizes memory allocation, as we don't need to store the entire contents of the data in memory before processing it. This is especially important for working with large files or streaming data over a network, where we want to minimize memory usage and reduce the risk of running out of memory.\nTo illustrate this, let's take an example where we need to transfer data between two services over a TCP connection. We could do this using the io.Copy() function in the Go standard library, which allows us to copy data from one io.Reader to one io.Writer. However, this approach requires that we allocate a buffer to hold the data being transferred, which can be a problem if we're working with large files or streaming data continuously.\nInstead, we can use the splice() system call to transfer data directly between the two connections without needing to allocate a buffer. The splice() system call allows us to efficiently transfer data between two file descriptors (e.g., network connections or files) without the need to copy the data into user space. This can greatly reduce the amount of memory needed to transfer data, and can improve performance by reducing the number of system calls needed to complete the transfer.\nHere's an example of how we can use splice() to transfer data between two network connections in Go:\nfunc transferData(src net.Conn, dst net.Conn) error {\n    // Create a buffer to hold data temporarily\n    buf := make([]byte, 64*1024)\n    \n    // Loop until there's no more data to transfer\n    for {\n        // Use splice to transfer data from the source connection to the destination connection\n        n, err := syscall.Splice(\n            int(src.(*net.TCPConn).File().Fd()), // File descriptor for the source connection\n            nil,\n            int(dst.(*net.TCPConn).File().Fd()), // File descriptor for the destination connection\n            nil,\n            len(buf), // Maximum amount of data to transfer\n            0,\n        )\n        if err != nil {\n            return err\n        }\n        \n        // If we've reached the end of the stream, return nil to indicate that the transfer completed successfully\n        if n == 0 {\n            return nil\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nIn this example, we're using the syscall.Splice() function to transfer data between the two network connections. The src and dst parameters are both net.Conn objects representing the source and destination connections, respectively.\nWe're also using a buffer to temporarily hold data as it's being transferred between the connections. In this example, we're using a buffer size of 64KB, but you can adjust this value to match your specific use case.\nOnce we've set up our buffer and connections, we enter a loop that repeatedly calls syscall.Splice() to transfer data between the connections. The len(buf) parameter specifies the maximum amount of data to transfer in each call to splice(), which helps to prevent excessive memory usage.\nIf splice() returns a value of 0, that means we've reached the end of the data stream and we can break out of the loop. If splice() returns an error, we return that error to the calling function.\nBy using splice() to transfer data between the connections, we can minimize memory allocation and improve performance, making it an ideal approach for streaming data in Go.\nConclusion\nIn this article, we've explored how to stream data in Go without allocating large amounts of memory. We've looked at using pipes and the io.Copy() function to read and write data, and we've seen how to use the splice() system call to transfer data between two network connections without allocating a buffer. By minimizing memory usage, we can improve performance and reduce\n","id":"https://proximab.github.io/blog/2022/streaming-data-with-go/","title":"Streaming data with Go"},"https://proximab.github.io/blog/2023/":{"body":"","id":"https://proximab.github.io/blog/2023/","title":""},"https://proximab.github.io/blog/2023/divide-and-conqour-using-span-partitioning/":{"body":"\nTemp\nTemp\nTemp\n...\nusing(){\n    //...\n}\n\n","id":"https://proximab.github.io/blog/2023/divide-and-conqour-using-span-partitioning/","title":"Divide and Conqour and data processing"}},"docInfo":{"https://proximab.github.io/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://proximab.github.io/blog/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://proximab.github.io/blog/2020/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://proximab.github.io/blog/2022/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://proximab.github.io/blog/2022/context-mapping/":{"body":963,"title":2},"https://proximab.github.io/blog/2022/streaming-data-with-go/":{"body":772,"title":3},"https://proximab.github.io/blog/2023/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://proximab.github.io/blog/2023/divide-and-conqour-using-span-partitioning/":{"body":4,"title":4}},"length":8},"lang":"English"};
